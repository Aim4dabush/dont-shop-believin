### What I Learned

I learned a lot about Firebase Auth and Firestore. All my code with Firebase was using their SDK methods. It was a challenge achieving different functionalities like dynamically updating data, getting and saving tokens, logging users out after a set time, etc. It was also my first time using css modules and sass together. I like to challenge myself with using different code and/or styling so I can more diverse with the different languages I could be working with in the real world.
